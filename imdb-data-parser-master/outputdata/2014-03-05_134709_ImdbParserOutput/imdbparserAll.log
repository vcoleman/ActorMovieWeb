CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: SUBMITTING UPDATES

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ==================

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: We rely on users of the database to submit corrections and additions to keep 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: the list as accurate and complete as possible. The most convenient method

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: of submitting them is via the movie mail-server's central collection service. 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: For a comprehensive guide send an e-mail message with the subject: 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:   HELP ADD FULL

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: to <mail-server@imdb.com>. 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: The instructions specific to the actors list are given below.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: KEYWORD INTERFACE

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: =================

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: This is the most flexible interface but can appear quite complex if you aren't

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: familiar with the organization of the database. 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: Additions

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ---------

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (1) mark the start of the data with the word:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     ACTOR

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (2) for each addition, include on a separate line an entry of the form:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <name>|<title>|<attributes>|<character name>|<order>

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     where:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <name> is the actors name in <surname>, <firstname> order. Please note

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:             the space after the comma as in: "Grant, Cary". 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <title> is the title of the movie or TV-series in which the actor 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:              appeared, please include the year of release as part of the title

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:              (see examples below).

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <attributes> records any award nominations or wins and in most cases will

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:                   be empty. Example attributes include:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (AA)           = academy award winner (best actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (AAN)          = academy award nominee (best actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (S:AA)         = academy award winner (best supporting actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (S:AAN)        = academy award nominee (best supporting actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (GG)           = golden globe winner (best drama actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        (GGN)          = golden globe nominee (best drama actor)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <character name>  is the character name of the actor.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      <order> is a number to record the position in which the actor appears in

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:              the credits (1=star billing)

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     The full additions guide contains more information on the formats. 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Notes:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      - Apart from the <name> and <title> all these fields are optional, but

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        please leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        of the data may be lost.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      - Guest appearances in TV-series are NOT eligible for the main actors and

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        actresses list. The person must have played a recurring role across a 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        number of episodes in order to be included. See the section describing

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        the biography database for an alternative method of adding this type of 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        information.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      - Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        a particular rock group appeared in a movie then include them under 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:        their individual names and not the name of the whole group.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:      - The actors and actresses sections are for people only. No animals.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Examples:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     ACTOR

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Grant, Cary|North by Northwest (1959)||Rogert Thornhill|1

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Grant, Cary|Awful Truth, The (1937)|||1

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Grant, Cary|Philadelphia Story, The (1940)|||

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Hopkins, Anthony|Silence of the Lambs, The (1990)|(AA)||

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (3) If the additions include a title that is new to the database, please also 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     include a section of the form:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     TITLE

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     <title>|<year>|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Example:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     TITLE

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     North by Northwest (1959)|1959|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Silence of the Lambs, The (1960)|1990|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (4) Mark the end of your data with the word

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     END

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     on a separate line.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (5) Mail the data to <add@imdb.com>. The mail-server will mail a receipt back

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     to you and place the data in the queue for processing by the list managers 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     in the next update.

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: Character Name Additions

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ------------------------

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: If you wish to add character names to *existing* entries in the database only,

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: use the keyword:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:   CHARA

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: and the format:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:   <name>|<title>|<character name>

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: Cast Ordering Additions

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: -----------------------

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: If you wish to add cast ordering information to *existing* entries in the 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: database only, use the keyword:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:   ORDER

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: and the format:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:   <name>|<title>|<order>

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: Deletions

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ---------

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: To delete an incorrect entry on the list, the format is similar to those 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: described above, but a '!' character is placed at the start of each entry. The

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: format is:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ACTOR

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: !<name>|<title>|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: For example:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: ACTOR

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: !Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: Corrections

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: -----------

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (1) Correcting a name across the whole database

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     If you spot a spelling error in a name in the database, use the keyword

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       NAMECORRECT

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     and the format:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       <current name>|<correct name>

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     For example:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       NAMECORRECT

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       Bogart, Humphry|Bogart, Humphrey|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (2) Replacing an individual entry

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Replacements can be made by deleting the incorrect entry and adding the 

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     correct version. For example:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       ACTOR

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       !Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       Grant, Cary|Notorious (1946)|||

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up: (3) Other corrections

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     Finally, if your correction cannot be expressed in the forms above, use

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     the keyword:

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:       CORRECT

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     and then include a description of your correction in a free text over as

CRITICAL - This line is fucked up:     many lines as you need.
